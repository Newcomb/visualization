<h1>Data Visualization Critiques</h1>
  <h2>Great Visualization</h2>
<h3><a href="https://www.wired.com/story/evolution-of-data-leaks/">Evolution of data leaks visualizaiton</a></h3>
  <p>The Data Leaks visualization follows Cairo's five qualities of great visualizations. It is based off of information the 
  reliable sources of CyberScout and the Identity Theft Resource Center. Therefore, we can argue that the data portrayed in the
  visualization is based on honest research. The Data Leaks visualization is also very functional, allowing several interactions.
  These interactions include being able to change the format of the displayed data for easier understanding and being able to use the
  mouse to inspect the amount of data leaked in a certain time period. The visualization is also quite pleasing to the eye, using 
  cool blue colors and a dark background gives off a calming vibe. Insight that is brought by the Data Leaks visualization
  includes evidence that the general public would have a difficult time coming by. I personally did not know the spread and patters
  of leaked data and was extremely interested in it because it is important but not everyday information. Finally, the information
  that the Data Leaks visualization has the ability to enlighten the minds of those who understand it. The visualization brings
  to light the number of data leaks that happen every year and the risks those bring to the table. After seeing this visualization
  people might be more likely to make stronger passwords or encrypt their data. This expands the viewers horizon of knowledge by illustrating
  all the ways that their secure online possesions can be hacked, causing them to question the security of the passwords they use.</p>
  <h2>Poor Visualization</h2>
<h3><a href="http://metrocosm.com/world-population-split-in-half-map/">World Population Split in Half</a></h3>
  <p>The World Population visualization is a poor example of a visualization because it does not do a good job of following all 5 of Cairo's
  qualities of great visualization. I do not believe that the data is displayed very truthfully even though the data was compiled
  by NASA. The creators of the visualization failed to mention areas in which people cannot live to go along with the articles arguement
  of all the free land for people to expand to. The data seems to be tryingt to portray the picture that there is a ton of land to 
  live on without the restraints of resources of food, water, etc. This visualization is also not functional at all. None of the graphics
  depicted allow interactions with the viewer, however one of the charts does use a timeline. The creator could have also used 
  better designing techniques. The colors used did not spark any emotion or feeling from me, especially in the first graphic of a map
  that depicts population spread in purple, black, and yellow. The World Population visualization does however bring some interesting
  insight. Most people do not know the exact spread of human population across earth and where the growing population will go is an
  interesting question to think about. While the visualization does bring to light the rising population projections and the possible
  solutions, I do not believe the people seeing this graphic would agree with the arguement because it does not take into consideration
  the countless other problems that come with population growth at this point. The World Population visualization falls short of
  expands viewers horizons by illustrating the amount of land leftover, but it fails to enlighten them with the knowledge of
  the resources we have to provide for more people along with what land is uninhabitable.</p>
  <h2>Making These Visualizations Better</h2>
  <p>To make the Data Leaks visualization better I would resize the horizon graphing so that the user could more easily see the 
  size and proportions of the data being portrayed. At first sight, I was a little confused on how to read it because it was
  very compressed into a small area of space. I would also go deeper into the security level that each data leak was performed on 
  that way the viewer might be more enlightened on what things that they could do to protect their electronic accounts and information.
  For the World Population Visualization, I would obviously include in the map graphic the spaces which are uninhabitable by human
  beings as well as include the population that human resources could maintain before jumping straight to where to put the overflow
  of people. Additionally, I would try to increase the capability of the graphics to please the eye. The dark background of the map
  graphic just did not stand out so I would try to add a little more life to it. The functionality of the World Population Visualization
  also needs to be increased because it does not really have any functionality at all. By adding interactive peices to the graphics
  such as displaying city names, country names, or dates when interacting with the mouse on the chart or graphic could greatly 
  increase the interest in the data trying to be displayed.</p>
  <h1>Notes</h1>
  <p>On this website I provided two visualizations, one great and one poor. For each visualization I explained what I thought made 
  it good or bad using Cairo's 5 qualities of great visualizations. To go further, I added the things that the creators of these 
  visualizations could add to make them more appealing to the 5 qualities as well as the people that view them.</p>
